        <p class="para">My hobby is dancing and doing gymnastics in my free time.
            Whenever I go to home from my school I like to practice the dance choreography that my sir
            taught me in the previous class after completing my home work. I am 12 years old and read 
            in class 7th standard. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally.
            Dancing, doing gymnastics or maybe learning new elements keep one always happy and busy. It 
            is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined,
            loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
